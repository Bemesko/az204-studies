## Getting Started
![](media/Pasted%20image%2020240128111413.png)
*Figure 1: 5 pillars of cloud infrastructure for cloud native applications*
- pets vs. cattle
### Deployment Options for containers
- container apps: kubernetes style applications but without the overhead of managing kubernetes itself
- web apps: great for web apps that don't require too many containers to run
- container instances: less opinionated building block than container apps. one container instance serves 1 container. usually interacted with via other services like aks
- kubernetes service: azure managed kubernetes infrastructure, exposing all kubernetes apis
- azure functions: functions as a service; like container apps functions run based on events; can support containers
- spring apps: ideal for spring boot or spring cloud applications
- red hat openshift: openshift environment managed by azure
### Azure Container Apps
![](media/Pasted%20image%2020240128112608.png)
- single revision mode

*Love the passive-agressiveness in this*

- job execution as well as regular apps
- sidecars vs. init containers
	- both access resources from the main container
	- sidecars have the same lifecycle as the main container and are tightly coupled
	- init containers run usually to setup the environment for the main container; the main container only runs when all its init containers finish without errors (exit code 0)
	- for loosely coupled containers it is best to create multiple container apps instead of putting everything in a single one

![](media/Pasted%20image%2020240128130834.png)
*"We are definitely better than our competitor, trust us!" (rate limit in docker hub is 100 pulls per 6 hours per ip address*
### Managed Identities
- limitations
	- init containers can't acccess managed identities
	- for private container registries you still need to pass a connection string using the app's secrets
### Ingresses
![](media/Pasted%20image%2020240128132527.png)
- external vs internal
	- external ingresses are publicly available
	- internal ingresses aren't publicly available and can use their own managed vnet or a custom one
- protocol types
	- http
	- tcp (only for custom vnets)
### Secrets
- Key vault integration, apparently
	- Container app needs a managed identity with the "Get" permission on the key vault
	- You set this up with an app secret that makes a reference to the key vault's secret
### Storage
- Container file system
	- Local storage available only to that container
	- is deleted once the container stops or restarts
- Ephemeral
	- Files on the replica that are acessible to the container and sidecards/init containers
	- Equivalent to emptyDir in Kubernetes
	- Not persistent, once a new replica is created this is deleted
- Azure Files
	- Can be mounted as volumes to multiple containers at once
	- Things are persistent
	- Everyone has access to everything in the file share
### Service Connector
- key components of a service connection
	- Source: Usually a compute service
	- Target: Usually a complementary service such as a database or cache storage
	- Client Type: How the connection will be handled (environment variables, connection strings)
	- Authentication Method: Managed identity, connection string or service principal

## Continuous Deployment with Azure Pipelines
- container apps task
### Agents
- token scopes for agents: **Agent Pools (read, manage)** and **Deployment group (read, manage)** scopes.
### Environments and Secrets
- secrets can be set at the pipeline scope using the UI, but it's better to use variable groups

## Managing Azure Container Apps
### Revisions
- uses for revisions
	- Mark the historical changes that happened in an app
	- Traffic splitting for A/B testing or blue green deployments
	- Quick rollbacks to stable versions
- revision modes
	- Single revision: one revision active at a time
	- Multiple: traffic is split between several revisions
- revision labels
	- Labels can be applied to one revision at a time and have an unique URL
	- Can be useful to redirect a certain group of users to a specific label (e.g. "dev", "stage")
	- Labels work best in conjunction with Multiple Revision mode
- traffic splitting
	- If apps are exposed through an external ingress you can setup how much traffic will be routed to each revision
- custom revision names
	- Revisions usually get assigned an auto generated name but you can specify it as well
### Container App Lifecycle
- Deployment
	- A new revision is created, the app is deployed and starts running
- Update
	- The app gets a new revision. Depending on the revision mode, the new revision will be deployed alongside the old one or will replace it
	- Zero downtime deployments -> if the revision mode is Single, the previous revision will only be deactivated when the new revision is already up and running
- Deactivation
	- Revisions can be deactivated manually or using rules to deactivate unused revisions
- Shutdown
	- The app can shutdown either by its revision being deactivated or by errors
### Scaling Options
- changing scaling rules creates new revisions
- horizontal scaling and replicas: each time a new instance of a revision is created, it exists in a new replica
- limits
	- minimum and maximum number of replicas for a revision
- rules
	- http
		- amount of simultaneous HTTP connections before scaling
	- tcp
		- amount of simulatneous TCP connections before scaling
	- custom
		- any KEDA supported scaler as well as CPU and Memory
	- multiple scale rules: multiple rules are treated with an OR instead of AND, so only one needs to be active to scale up
- behaviors
	- each behavior can be customized for the app
	- polling interval: 
	- cooldown period: 
	- scale up stabilization window
	- scale down stabilization window
	- scale up step
	- scale down step
	- scaling algorithm
### Ingress Settings for HTTP Splitting and Bluegreen
- traffic splitting: setting up a percentage for traffic to be redirected to each active revision
- bluegreen deployments: combining revisions, traffic weights and labels to have a blue and a green environment, in which one is stable and the other is updated and tested before becoming the new stable
- direct revision access: can be setup to redirect users to a specific revision
- change types
	- revision scope: create new revisions
		- changes in the container
		- changes in scaling rules
	- application scope: apply to all revisions at once
		- changing secrets
		- ingress settings
