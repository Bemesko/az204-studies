## Getting Started
![](media/Pasted%20image%2020240128111413.png)
*Figure 1: 5 pillars of cloud infrastructure for cloud native applications*
- pets vs. cattle
### Deployment Options for containers
- container apps: kubernetes style applications but without the overhead of managing kubernetes itself
- web apps: great for web apps that don't require too many containers to run
- container instances: less opinionated building block than container apps. one container instance serves 1 container. usually interacted with via other services like aks
- kubernetes service: azure managed kubernetes infrastructure, exposing all kubernetes apis
- azure functions: functions as a service; like container apps functions run based on events; can support containers
- spring apps: ideal for spring boot or spring cloud applications
- red hat openshift: openshift environment managed by azure
### Azure Container Apps

- single revision mode

*Love the passive-agressiveness in this*

- job execution as well as regular apps
- sidecars vs. init containers
	- both access resources from the main container
	- sidecars have the same lifecycle as the main container and are tightly coupled
	- init containers run usually to setup the environment for the main container; the main container only runs when all its init containers finish without errors (exit code 0)
	- for loosely coupled containers it is best to create multiple container apps instead of putting everything in a single one

*"We are definitely better than our competitor, trust us!" (rate limit in docker hub is 100 pulls per 6 hours per ip address*
### Managed Identities
- limitations
	- init containers can't acccess managed identities
	- for private container registries you still need to pass a connection string using the app's secrets
### Ingresses
![](media/Pasted%20image%2020240128132527.png)
- external vs internal
	- external ingresses are publicly available
	- internal ingresses aren't publicly available and can use their own managed vnet or a custom one
- protocol types
	- http
	- tcp (only for custom vnets)
### Secrets
- Key vault integration, apparently
	- Container app needs a managed identity with the "Get" permission on the key vault
	- You set this up with an app secret that makes a reference to the key vault's secret
### Storage
- Container file system
	- Local storage available only to that container
	- is deleted once the container stops or restarts
- Ephemeral
	- Files on the replica that are acessible to the container and sidecards/init containers
	- Equivalent to emptyDir in Kubernetes
	- Not persistent, once a new replica is created this is deleted
- Azure Files
	- Can be mounted as volumes to multiple containers at once
	- Things are persistent
	- Everyone has access to everything in the file share
### Service Connector
- key components of a service connection
	- Source: Usually a compute service
	- Target: Usually a complementary service such as a database or cache storage
	- Client Type: How the connection will be handled (environment variables, connection strings)
	- Authentication Method: Managed identity, connection string or service principal
