This is the Obsidian vault I'm using to study for the [[AZ-204]] Microsoft exam. I'll be updating it with my notes and use them to try to make sense of it all.

Days until exam: 37
## Study Stages
- [x] Initial priming about all concepts in the test
- [ ] Watch the Microsoft Learning Path modules, doing the ones I'm not familiar with first; Avoid writing too many notes, only questions
- [ ] Take at least 1 practice assesment per week
- [ ] Listen to my AZ204 YouTube playlist during my downtime
